# Image Augmentation Web Application

In most data science project workflow, raw data is very important. The larger and more robust the dataset is, the better a machine learning model
can be trained. During my stint at Amaris AI, I've helped to build an Image Augmentation Web Application, where employees can augment their raw
images to generate a larger dataset. There are two main features, 'Single Folder Augmentation' and 'Dual Folder Augmentation' (for augmentation of 
raw image and its mask). Several augmentation options are available to choose from, dependent on the needs of the user. This project was built in Python,
using the Django framework.
